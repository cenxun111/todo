          Google I/O kicks off next week, and even though it's a developers
          conference, it's likely we'll see some major product announcements,
          including more details on Android 12 and possibly Pixel hardware. The
          company skipped I/O last year due to the pandemic, so there's a lot to
          catch up on. How to watch Google I/O Google I/O is entirely virtual
          this year and free for everyone to attend, running May 18 through 20.
          The opening keynote starts at 10 a.m. PT/1 p.m. ET on May 18. Google
          has also published an official schedule for keynotes and breakout
          sessions. To sign up for Google I/O, you just need to sign in to your
          Google account and register for the event. For more like this

          I/O. Android 12 updates Android 12 could bring the biggest visual
          change to the operating system in years. Leaked screenshots emerged
          earlier this year showing a new interface, widgets and privacy
          features. Watch this: Our first look at Android 12 6:27 While the
          first developer beta released in February had a lot of changes under
          the hood, there were a few hints in the Settings app pointing to a
          complete redesign on the way. Referred to as "Material NEXT" in a leak
          from XDA Developers, we may see changes to the lock screen,
          notifications panel and a new theming system. It's likely Google will
          announce the public beta of Android 12 at Google I/O, so we could see
          the first official look at Android's new paint job, too. The timing of
          I/O also roughly lines up with Google's schedule shown below for
          Android 12 beta releases. Read more: Everything else we're expecting
          in Android 12. google-android-12-release-schedule.png This is Google's
          own schedule for Android 12 beta releases. Screenshot by Jason
          Cipriani/CNET Pixel Watch, Pixel Buds A-Series, WearOS We've been
          hearing rumors about a Pixel Watch for years. Could Google I/O finally
          be the event to showcase Google's first branded wearable? A leak in
          April from Jon Prosser showed a circular watch likely powered by a new
          version of WearOS. The renders show a watch without a bezel around the
          screen, no physical buttons, interchangeable watch straps and
          indications the watch will have a heart rate sensor. This is also the
          first major Google event since acquiring Fitbit. It seems unlikely
          that we'll see new hardware as the Fitbit Luxe was just announced, but
          Google could announce broader integration of Fitbit within the Google
          ecosystem, or even in WearOS itself. Another WearOS rumor from Korean
          news outlet MT points to the upcoming Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 running
          Google's operating system instead of Samsung's own Tizen, which we
          might hear more about during I/O. pixel-buds-a-android-twitter.png
          Android (Twitter account) Google may have already accidentally leaked
          the newest Pixel Buds in an email to Nest users in April, followed up
          with an accidental tweet from Google's own Android account in May.
          Just like the "A series" of Pixel phones, the Pixel Buds A may cost
          less than the original Buds that currently sell for $180. The leak
          also showed a new mint green color, and the tweet said the earbuds
          will support the new Fast Pair feature for quick Bluetooth device
          pairing on Android. It seems highly unlikely we'll see the Pixel 5a
          announced at Google I/O, given that there's currently a global chip
          shortage and the company also issued an official statement saying the
          phone would be released later in the year to quash rumors of its
          cancellation. The Pixel 4a was released in August 2020, so given that
          timing, it makes sense for Google to save the 5a announcement until
          later in the year. The other wildcard could be Google's rumored mobile
          processor. Codenamed Whitechapel, it may be developed in conjunction
          with Samsung and make its debut in the upcoming Pixel 6. Again, it's
          unlikely we'll see that phone announced at I/O, but announcing the
          chip could give some heads-up for developers. Google Assistant and
          smart home products Google I/O has had some show-stopping demos in the
          past, like when the Google Duplex AI had a natural phone conversation
          with a real person to make a hair appointment. While we don't have any
          leaks pointing to exact capabilities coming to the Google Assistant,
          maybe we could hear news of the new Assistant coming to more Android
          devices, not just Pixel phones. An official blog post also said to
          expect new features and new product announcements in smart home.
          Google just launched the $99 Nest Audio toward the end of 2020, so
          maybe it could get some new features, or we could see a new version of
          the Nest Hub Max. There's also speculation about an updated
          Chromecast, thanks to an FCC filing that appeared in March. Google I/O
